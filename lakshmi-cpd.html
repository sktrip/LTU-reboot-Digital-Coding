    <h2>1.1 - 10/11/2020</h2>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>

    In today's session, I have got to know few people and learnt the concepts of internet and web development.

    I enjoyed the feeling of being in a classroom,though a virtual class (after a long time).</br>

    Learning something new is always a wonderful experience :)</p>
    </br>

    <h2>1.3 - 12/11/2020</h2>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>

    <p>All setting up to start working.Today, have installed and set up github desktop, Visual studio code and created my own github account.

    </br>Started using freecodecamp for coding practice as suggested by Luke in today's meeting.

    Coding sounded scary before I started learning it and now it's kinda fun. Got to see how this progresses

    <h2>1.4 - 13/11/2020</h2>

    <h2>2.1 - 16/11/2020</h2>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>

    Created our first html file today and saw the result on a web browser (like an actual web page :) )

    Checked in this file to github client. I need to do a bit more practicing HTML now.
    </p>
    <p>
    <h2>2.2 - 17/11/2020</h2>
    <h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>

    Today I have created the HTML files to include links(opening in the same window/ in a new window/ navigating through an email app)

    Including links in html files was a bit tricky, cos one simple mistake in the link src is making the code useless,so need to be careful with it.

    Understood how we use br and list tags in html; Also, how to comment/uncomment content in a webpage.</br>

    Took HTML quiz on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></br>
    Here is my result
