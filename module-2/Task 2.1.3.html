    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p> Understanding, how the <strong>Headings</strong> are shown on a html page</p>
    <h2> Headings by hierarchy</h2>
    <p><strong>HTML</strong> defines six levels of headings. Heading elements are <em>H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 </em> with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least. This is how Heading tags should be used. Where you place this heading has no effect on SEO what so ever.
    
    <h3>This is a h3 heading</h3>
    <p>Creating different sized headings helps when we want to create sections/ subsections in a content.</p>
    <h4>Heading 4 for a Sub-section</h4>
    <p>Creating a <strong>HTML page</strong> is simpler when we follow <em>the rules</em></p></p>
    <h5>Fifth heading of the page</h5>
    <p>Creating a paragraph, to fill in some cotent in my html page</p>
    <h6>H6 heading</h6>
    <p>This heading might be less important in heading hierarchy</p>
